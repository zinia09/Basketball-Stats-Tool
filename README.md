# Basketball Stats Tool
## Techdegree_Project_2
This project involves cleaning up player data and organizing players into equal teams for the upcoming basketball season. The program is built using Python data types to create structures that can store and organize a team of basketball players into distributed teams. The tool is designed to balance the teams by the total number of players and generate statistics for a given team.
